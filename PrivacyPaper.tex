Devices that collect and use location data are practically ubiquitous in our society. Since the data collected by these devices can be used to infer highly private information about their users, a need for privacy of location data has arisen. This paper aims to introduce the reader to the concept of location privacy and its possible applications.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In modern society, location aware devices are all around us. Ranging from GPS navigation systems in cars, to smartphones which can, next to GPS, discover their location through a variety technologies, most notably cellular and Wi-Fi networks.

The location awareness of mobile phones provides many opportunities for existing or new services, such as navigating while riding a bike, discovering whether friends are nearby or even finding a date in your area. The users however, usually remain uninformed about how accurately their location is transferred to the service provider or displayed to other users.

As shown in a study by \citet{danezis2005much}, users are generally not very concerned about sharing their location data with a service provider.
